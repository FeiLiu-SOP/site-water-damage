      question: "Can gutter apron, drip edge, and roofline metal be sequenced with siding work?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Roofline metals are frequently coordinated so laps do not trap moisture behind new courses.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is insulation or continuous sheathing discussed when walls are opened?",
      answer:
        "Sometimes, yes. When cavities are exposed, energy code paths and air barrier continuity may be reviewed.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you help prioritize repairs after hail or wind events?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Impact patterns, corner damage, and accessory metal deformation are commonly triaged for urgent versus deferred work.",
    },
